# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning in Python

This repository contains the code and resources for a loan approval prediction system using machine learning algorithms implemented in Python.

## Project Overview

The loan approval prediction system aims to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on various factors such as the applicant's income, credit score, loan amount, and other relevant features. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the system can analyze historical loan data to learn patterns and make accurate predictions on new loan applications.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- `models/`: Includes trained machine learning models saved in pickle (.pkl) format.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks providing step-by-step explanations of the loan approval prediction process.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts implementing the loan approval prediction system.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper modules used in the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the loan approval prediction process step by step.
4. Alternatively, you can directly use the pre-trained models in the `models/` directory by running the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory. These scripts provide a simple interface for predicting loan approval based on input data.
